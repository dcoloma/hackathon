# Challenge 4
## Name
Browser Plugin using ReCon API
## Description
ReCon API is an API developed on top of the Dataset gathered by the ReCon project. It lets developers check if an app is leaking PI or whether a domain is receiving information from multiple apps.
The idea would be using this API to develop a browser plugin that informs user about different aspects:
Provide information available about the apps (based on ReCon) when browsing Google Play or App Store or information about bad domains detected by Recon.

# Challenge 5
## Name
Application Auditor
## Description
ReCon API is an API developed on top of the Dataset gathered by the ReCon project. It lets developers check if an app is leaking PI or whether a domain is receiving information from multiple apps.
The idea would be using this API to develop an Android application that let users scan their Android apps and tell them if any of the apps has been spotted before sharing PI. A variant of this approach would be using ReCon API to detect potentially bad connetions.
